# Installation

Ensure the Rust toolchain is installed.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Optional: PGlite in-memory backend

Enable tests without a real Postgres server.

```bash
just pglite-assets        # download pglite.wasm and pglite.data
cargo build --features pglite
```

Run tests with PGlite:

```bash
cargo test --features pglite
```
